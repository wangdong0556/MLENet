# MLENet: Multi-Level Efficient Network for Human Keypoint Estimation

## Introduction

MLENet is a high-efficiency network designed for accurate human keypoint estimation. By utilizing multi-level feature extraction on single-scale features, MLENet achieves a good balance between precision and computational efficiency. The model effectively captures local, spatial, and global information to enhance keypoint localization.

## Highlights

- Efficient extraction of multi-level features (local, middle, global) without costly multi-scale fusion  
- Incorporates attention mechanisms to boost feature representation  
- Outperforms many state-of-the-art methods on COCO and MPII benchmarks  
- More computationally efficient than traditional multi-scale fusion networks

## Results

Extensive experiments on standard datasets demonstrate that MLENet achieves superior accuracy and speed, making it suitable for real-world applications requiring efficient human pose estimation.
